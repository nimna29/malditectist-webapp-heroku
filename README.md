## AI and Machine Learning-based Malware  Detection Application
#### Development Of This Repository - Web Application Development
<br>
<p>This project aims to develop an AI and Machine Learning-based Malware Detection model to protect computer systems from malware attacks. The model will combine signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques and will be trained using a unique classified dataset. A web portal will be developed to provide users with a GUI to interact with the model and upload files to detect malware. The project outcomes include a machine learning model for detecting malware with good accuracy and a user interactive website to upload files and get detailed reports about malware.</p>


# Welcome to MalDitectist

<p>An innovative project that utilizes AI and Machine Learning to develop an advanced Malware Detection model. The model integrated signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques and was trained using a unique classified PE file dataset. The project aims to provide a solution for computer systems to protect them from malware attacks.</p>
